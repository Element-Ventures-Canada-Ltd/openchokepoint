# OpenChokepoint (working name)

An open grammar for mapping supply-chain dependencies: who supplies what, from where, under whose jurisdiction, and on what evidence. It gives analysts, researchers and industry one shared way to record chokepoints so registries can be compared, validated and combined.

> **Status:** private preview. The project name is a placeholder pending a name-availability check.

## What is here

| Path | Content |
|---|---|
| `schema/openchokepoint.yaml` | Object and link types (v0.2.0-draft): Entity, Facility, Capability, Programme; and the digital thread: Component, SerialItem, MaterialLot, ProcessStep, EvidenceRecord, CriticalItem |
| `tools/validate.py` | Validator for instance files |
| `examples/synthetic-example.yaml` | A fully fictional worked example (space turbopump supply chain) |
| `examples/synthetic-turbopump-thread.yaml` | A fully fictional digital thread: one rotor traced from material lot to assembly, plus three critical items |
| `docs/digital-thread.md` | The digital thread in plain language |
| `tests/` | Validator tests (`python3 -m unittest discover -s tests`) |

```bash
pip install pyyaml
python3 tools/validate.py examples/*.yaml
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests
```

## Design rules

- **Jurisdiction of control, not residency.** Every entity records where it is incorporated and who controls it.
- **Evidence on every record.** Each object and link carries an evidence grade, sources and an as-of date.
- **Announced is not operational.** Lifecycle keeps the two apart.
- **Synthetic only, for now.** External data contributions open after review; until then the validator rejects any non-synthetic record.
